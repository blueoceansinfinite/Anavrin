    "text": "About this site\n\nI go by the name of Aanya Pandith, but I would rather be known as the person who is interested in everything. I am a skeptic, and i have a tendency called ‘Philia sophia,’ which literally translates to the love for wisdom. I believe in skepticism, one might feel that they are being interrogated, when I am around. I find talking to people and learning about their perspective extremely enriching, as it also helps me get different perspectives on any notion. I am currently intersted in game theory, cognitive studies, epigenetic and heterotopia, apart from design and art.\nThe more I know, the more I want know. I more I want to know, the more deeper and wider my perspective becomes. This process of constant transformation and metamorphosis of the object of thought is awe inspiring. You realise, one can never be right or wrong, because the notion of right and wrong dosn’t exist. only sides of each coin exist, which is subjective.\nMy professional expertise lies in creative coding. Yet my creative endeavors drive me for creating pathways to combine the various fields of art and design and creating a juncture where they all meet."

    "text": "A rule of thumb that has stood the test of time and have gauged humanity to advancement, is curiosity. Question everything, even if it sounds absurd. Chance and happenstance are intriguing, as they infer to something that is uncontrollable and the oblivious. Yet, they somehow seem predictable, they occur in a pattern. This exactly is where the notion of order in chaos roots from.\nWe don’t just see things as they are, we question every single aspect of it, until be squeeze every last bit of oblivion from that concept.\nThe coding environment in and of itself can be viewed as a heterotopia. For some, it comes with ease, for some it is frustrating and some bite their fingers in the process. Here, I like to believe in Nietzsche’s prospect of “will to power” and persist on my expedition to learn more."
