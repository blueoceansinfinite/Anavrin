    "text": "About this site\nI go by the name of Aanya Pandith, but I would rather be known as the person who is interested in everything. I am a skeptic, and i have a tendency called ‘Philia sophia,’ which literally translates to the love for wisdom. I believe in skepticism, one might feel that they are being interrogated, when I am around. I find talking to people and learning about their perspective extremely enriching, as it also helps me get different perspectives on any notion. I am currently interested in game theory, cognitive studies, epigenetic and heterotopia, apart from design and art.\nThe more I know, the more I want know. I more I want to know, the more deeper and wider my perspective becomes. This process of constant transformation and metamorphosis of the object of thought is awe inspiring. You realise, one can never be right or wrong, because the notion of right and wrong dosen’t exist. only sides of each coin exist, which is subjective.\nMy professional expertise lies in creative coding. Yet my creative endeavors drive me for creating pathways to combine the various fields of art and design and creating a juncture where they all meet."

    "text": "A rule of thumb that has stood the test of time and have gauged humanity to advancement, is curiosity. Question everything, even if it sounds absurd. Chance and happenstance are intriguing, as they infer to something that is uncontrollable and the oblivious. Yet, they somehow seem predictable, they occur in a pattern. This exactly is where the notion of order in chaos roots from.\nWe don’t just see things as they are, we question every single aspect of it, until be squeeze every last bit of oblivion from that concept.\nThe coding environment in and of itself can be viewed as a heterotopia. For some, it comes with ease, for some it is frustrating and some bite their fingers in the process. Here, I like to believe in Nietzsche’s prospect of “will to power” and persist on my expedition to learn more.\n\n## A1: Generative Garden\nRayna Singh, Aanya Pandith, Diya Bijoy, Naman Rajoria, Soumya Saboo\n\nConcept Note\n\nIn Islamic culture, creating a garden is equivalent to building a piece of heaven on earth. The main objective of this art piece is to fabricate an immersive 3D garden that reimagines natural landscapes through digital media using code. The title “Anavrin,” is Nirvana spelled backwards, the reason for initiating this title is to reinstate the serenity that a garden brings to the visitor. Our main objective is to mirror a real-world garden, or rather our interpretation of the same, onto a digital stage. Hence, we use the mirror as our main conduit for this exercise and hold up a mirror on the word ‘Nirvana.’ Nirvana can be interpreted as a place or state of oblivion to care, pain, or external reality.\nOur intent wasn’t just to create a mere replication of a garden using the varied and vibrant mathematical functions that we learnt. Rather, we wanted to create a body of work that echoes it’s origin, that is laid with embedded metaphors and meaning. We wanted it to be both a visual and philosophical exploration and creation.\nThis project blends art, ecology, and technology to create an environment that evolves based on the contributions of each teammate. We have established pathways for the viewers or spectators to not only eye the art piece but interact with it. Our philosophy dictates that if art can’t make you stop, look and interact, if it can’t make you think, there is no point in calling it art. We didn’t want to infer the metaphor or the alt text we use in this, instead, we left it to the viewer with any discretion to figure out how the garden is laid out and the purpose of each element. Parallel to the beginning of every epic, we start off with the sky. The sky is the poetry cloud, a cluster of disconinuities laid out in a channel, they indicate the presence of divinity and pivot change. Then we proceed to the flowers, that change colour and shape and position, they embody all material objects. After which we have the trees, which grow and perish, they are used to metaphorise change. We have butterflies in the composition that embody the untimely notion of life and death and life after death. Finally we have a pond, a water body to symbolise rejuvenation.\nUsing p5.js, WEBL and learning how to put everything together felt difficult and overwhelming to a lot of us. But we persisted and figured out how to navigate through the tough times. For the purpose of creating our digital ecosystem, we considered and looked to Mother Nature for inspiration. We developed and formulated an ecosystem. Each element is a contribution of each individual and their creative expression in the most expressive way. It also reflects the diversity and convergence of our minds and ideas and how they all formulate and meet at a common ground. The purpose of this art piece is to evoke the sense of being in a garden and trying to visualise the garden but in a more visceral manner.\n\n\nGarden Elements & Math Concepts\n1) Flowers\nMath Concept: Parametric Equations\n\nThe flower shape is defined using parametric equations in polar coordinates.\nIn the code, this equation generates radial symmetry, giving the flower a structured petal arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Terrain\nMath Concept: Julia Fractals\n\nThe Julia set determines which areas are water or land.\nFormula: z=z^2+c\nThe rule takes a number, changes it using a formula and checks if it stays small or grows big.\nIn the code, it creates a procedural landscape where blue areas represent water, and green areas represent land.\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Trees\nMath Concept: Geometric Progression\n\nGeometric progression is a sequence where each term is multiplied by a fixed ratio.\nLn​=L0​×rn, where the branch length shrinks by 70% each step.\nEach branch recursively creates three smaller branches, reducing in size until the length is 10 or less.\n\n\n\n4) Butterflies\nMath Concept: Circular Motion\n\nCircular motion describes movement along a curved path where an object’s position changes based on sine and cosine functions.\nFormula: x=rcos(θ),y=rsin(θ)\nEach butterfly moves in a circular path by updating its xxx and yyy coordinates using cosine and sine functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n6) Clouds\nMath Concept: Euclidean Distance\n\nEuclidean distance measures how far two points are from each other in a straight line.\nFormula:\nd=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2d = d=(x2​−x1​)2+(y2​−y1​)2​\nIn the code, it calculates the distance between the mouse and each cloud to adjust their size and transparency.\nCloser clouds appear bigger and brighter, while farther clouds appear smaller and more transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess & Practise\nWe began by exploring natural patterns and generative algorithms, experimenting with different plant growth models, fractals and interactive elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Sketch\nAll of this came down for the production of this final sketch:\n:::  :::"

Truly follow the devotee, and realise that the real source of strength is that divine energy. ~Dr. Balamuralikrishna Music transcends human psyche. Not everyone can sing, but everyone can feel emotions. The mark of a exceptional singer is to evocative the ubiquitous ‘Bhaav’ or emotion inside the heart.

It integrates data from multiple sources to provide a holistic view of physical and mental well-being. I aspired to be a professional badminton player. I embarked on this journey. My coach suggested me to wear a FitBit everyday and track my progress. This habit stayed with me for a long time, even after an injury dispurted my sports careere. I didn't stop wearing my FitBit or exercising. Little did I know it was going to turn out to be so useful. The primary data source for this project is my Fitbit, which tracked workouts, sleep, heart rate, steps, and other fitness metrics. Complementing this, is Digital Wellbeing data which offers insights into technology usage patterns, capturing screen time and its impact on mental health. Additionally, a health tracker app Headspace, which recorded my mood, stress levels, anxiety, depression scores, and other lifestyle factors such as meditation habits and caffeine intake as a daily journal practise. By combining these datasets, this project explores correlations between fitness activities, mental health, and daily habits, visualized through interactive charts and diagrams. The goal is to uncover patterns that reveal how exercise, sleep, and technology use intertwine to shape overall health, providing a data-driven narrative of resilience and personal growth. Looking back at the dates, and the progress I would have never thought that I would be able to make these connections by myself. It was exclusively throguh this project that I am able to reflect on my self.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/section&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Section: Early Beginnings --&gt;\n    &lt;section id=\"early-beginnings\"&gt;\n        &lt;h2&gt;Early Beginnings (June 2016)&lt;/h2&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;In June 2016, I embarked on my professional badminton journey, driven by a desire to represent my country in the Olympics. I remember seeing P.V. Sindhu win her first silver and that was my Eureka moment to start. My days were filled with diverse workouts, from high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to strength training and cycling. On June 12, I tackled a 27-minute HIIT session, burning 540 calories with my heart rate peaking at 133 bpm, feeling happy before the workout but fatigued afterward. This mix of emotions became a recurring theme, reflecting the physical demands and mental rewards of my efforts. My sleep was robust, averaging 7-9 hours, though stress and fatigue occasionally crept in, especially after intense sessions like the 94-minute HIIT workout on June 16, which burned 855 calories and left me energized despite starting happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Workout and Intensity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This Sankey diagram illustrates the relationship between workout types and their intensity levels in 2016, highlighting how HIIT and cycling often aligned with high-intensity efforts, while yoga was more balanced across intensities. The flow visualizes the frequency and connection between exercises like strength training and their high or medium intensity.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-sankey\" data-src=\"visualisation/22824857\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22824857/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"sankey visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Split Map of Workout Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This Sankey visualization breaks down workout patterns by type and day of the week, showing how weekends often featured HIIT and yoga, while weekdays leaned toward cycling and strength training.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-sankey\" data-src=\"visualisation/22822024\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22822024/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"sankey visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/section&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Section: Building Momentum --&gt;\n    &lt;section id=\"building-momentum\"&gt;\n        &lt;h2&gt;Building Momentum (July 2016 - December 2016)&lt;/h2&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;As summer approached, I changed my routine to include yoga and running with strength and cardio. Around this time, I became interested in professional sports, aiming to be a professional badminton player. I started this journey with my coach's advice to wear a FitBit daily to track my progress.In July 2016, I pushed my limits with a 114-minute cycling session on July 1. I burned 693 calories and felt energized, despite my heart rate hitting 178 bpm. Yoga became essential for balance. A 90-minute session on June 18 helped me manage stress, even though I often felt tired afterwards.My daily calorie intake was around 2000-3000 kcal, which supported my active lifestyle. I also drank 1.9 liters of water each day. By December, I balanced intense running sessions, like 115 minutes on June 27 where I burned 976 calories, with restorative yoga. I maintained a body fat percentage of 28.5% and a VO2 Max of 38.4, showing good cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Workout Intensity Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This Sankey visualization quantifies workout intensity numerically, showing the distribution of low, medium, and high-intensity workouts during late 2016. High-intensity sessions like running and HIIT dominated, with medium-intensity yoga providing balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-sankey\" data-src=\"visualisation/22824843\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22824843/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"sankey visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Calorie Burn Trends&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This chart tracks calorie burn across workouts in 2016, revealing peaks during high-intensity sessions like HIIT (up to 976 calories) and running, contrasted with lower but consistent calorie expenditure in yoga sessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/22824529\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22824529/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Workout Type Circle&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This circular hierarchy visualization organizes workout types, emphasizing the prominence of cycling and strength training, with yoga and running forming significant but smaller segments of my routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy\" data-src=\"visualisation/22824514\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22824514/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"hierarchy visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/section&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Section: Consistency and Challenges --&gt;\n    &lt;section id=\"consistency\"&gt;\n        &lt;h2&gt;Consistency and Challenges (2017 - 2020)&lt;/h2&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;Over the next few years, I stuck to a routine, but data gaps show some inconsistent tracking. When I recorded my workouts, they included cycling, HIIT, and strength training, with some yoga for mental clarity. My mood before workouts often changed between happy and stressed, reflecting life's demands. However, I usually felt an energy boost after exercising. My sleep varied from 4 to 9 hours, which affected recovery. Still, my resting heart rate (50-89 bpm) and steps taken (up to 19,000 daily) showed I was committed to staying active. Calorie burn ranged widely, from 125 calories in a short yoga session to 993 in a 98-minute strength workout in August 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Mood Before and After Workouts&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This pictogram visualizes mood shifts, showing a trend of moving from stressed or tired to energized or neutral post-workout. Strength and HIIT sessions particularly boosted my mood, enhancing mental resilience.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-pictogram\" data-src=\"visualisation/22822804\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22822804/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"pictogram visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Workout Type Hierarchy&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This radial visualization organizes workout types hierarchically, illustrating how cycling and strength training were central, with yoga providing mental clarity during challenging years.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy\" data-src=\"visualisation/22824836\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22824836/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"hierarchy visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Big Spot Graph&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This scatter plot highlights relationships between steps taken and calorie burn, showing how high-step days (e.g., 19,000 steps) often aligned with intense cycling or running sessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\" data-src=\"visualisation/22824199\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22824199/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"scatter visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/section&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Highlight section emphasizing resilience --&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"highlight\"&gt;\n        &lt;h2&gt;A Journey of Resilience&lt;/h2&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;Through global challenges and personal growth, my fitness routine became a cornerstone of mental and physical strength, adapting to life's ebb and flow with unwavering commitment.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Section: Resilience Through Change --&gt;\n    &lt;section id=\"resilience\"&gt;\n        &lt;h2&gt;Resilience Through Change (2021 - 2023)&lt;/h2&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;The early 2020s brought new challenges, likely due to global events, but my fitness journey persisted.

from over. Due to my injury I had to quit Bandminton, and due to Srishti I had to quit on life itself. But, my body is paying the price for my neglect. I am working towards healthy practises and focusing on my mental well-being as well&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Section: Reflections and Future Goals --&gt;\n    &lt;section id=\"reflections\"&gt;\n        &lt;h2&gt;Reflections and Future Goals&lt;/h2&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;Over nearly ten years, my fitness journey has been about discipline, adaptability, and growth. I've dealt with mood swings, from stressed to energized, using exercise for mental and physical strength. My steady body fat percentage (28.5%) and VO2 Max (38.4) show stability. Meanwhile, my varied calorie burns (104–994 calories) and distances (0.52–14.84 km) demonstrate versatility. Looking ahead, I want to deepen my yoga practice for stress relief and increase my endurance with longer runs. I'll keep the balance that has defined my journey. This timeline is about more than workouts, it's about becoming a healthier, happier me. I wish I could go back to my old body, I was full of energy, but the stress and anorexia has stolen the fire away. I try to drink enough water and go to the gym everyday. But, somewhere I will have to accept the fact that I can't go back. the way ahead is forward, the sooner I realise it is better.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Comprehensive Data Overview&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This interactive table allows exploration of all workout data categories, from calories to sleep hours, providing a searchable snapshot of my fitness metrics over nearly a decade, with filters for workout type and mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\" data-src=\"visualisation/22822299\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22822299/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"table visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Super Tree of Fitness Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This hierarchical visualization organizes all fitness metrics into a super tree, showing how workout types, moods, and body metrics interrelate, with a focus on the balance achieved in 2025 through diverse exercises.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy\" data-src=\"visualisation/22824518\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22824518/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"hierarchy visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"visual-section\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Tree of Workout Evolution&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This tree visualization traces the evolution of my workout preferences, showing a shift toward endurance-based activities like running and cycling in recent years, with yoga as a consistent anchor.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy\" data-src=\"visualisation/22824656\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22824656/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"hierarchy visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Footer with copyright information --&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;© 2025 Aanya Pandith.
