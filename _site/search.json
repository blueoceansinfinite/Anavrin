    "text": "About this site\nI go by the name of Aanya Pandith, but I would rather be known as the person who is interested in everything. I am a skeptic, and i have a tendency called ‘Philia sophia,’ which literally translates to the love for wisdom. I believe in skepticism, one might feel that they are being interrogated, when I am around. I find talking to people and learning about their perspective extremely enriching, as it also helps me get different perspectives on any notion. I am currently interested in game theory, cognitive studies, epigenetic and heterotopia, apart from design and art.\nThe more I know, the more I want know. I more I want to know, the more deeper and wider my perspective becomes. This process of constant transformation and metamorphosis of the object of thought is awe inspiring. You realise, one can never be right or wrong, because the notion of right and wrong dosen’t exist. only sides of each coin exist, which is subjective.\nMy professional expertise lies in creative coding. Yet my creative endeavors drive me for creating pathways to combine the various fields of art and design and creating a juncture where they all meet."

    "text": "A rule of thumb that has stood the test of time and have gauged humanity to advancement, is curiosity. Question everything, even if it sounds absurd. Chance and happenstance are intriguing, as they infer to something that is uncontrollable and the oblivious. Yet, they somehow seem predictable, they occur in a pattern. This exactly is where the notion of order in chaos roots from.\nWe don’t just see things as they are, we question every single aspect of it, until be squeeze every last bit of oblivion from that concept.\nThe coding environment in and of itself can be viewed as a heterotopia. For some, it comes with ease, for some it is frustrating and some bite their fingers in the process. Here, I like to believe in Nietzsche’s prospect of “will to power” and persist on my expedition to learn more.\n\n## A1: Generative Garden\nRayna Singh, Aanya Pandith, Diya Bijoy, Naman Rajoria, Soumya Saboo\n\nConcept Note\n\nIn Islamic culture, creating a garden is equivalent to building a piece of heaven on earth. The main objective of this art piece is to fabricate an immersive 3D garden that reimagines natural landscapes through digital media using code. The title “Anavrin,” is Nirvana spelled backwards, the reason for initiating this title is to reinstate the serenity that a garden brings to the visitor. Our main objective is to mirror a real-world garden, or rather our interpretation of the same, onto a digital stage. Hence, we use the mirror as our main conduit for this exercise and hold up a mirror on the word ‘Nirvana.’ Nirvana can be interpreted as a place or state of oblivion to care, pain, or external reality.\nOur intent wasn’t just to create a mere replication of a garden using the varied and vibrant mathematical functions that we learnt. Rather, we wanted to create a body of work that echoes it’s origin, that is laid with embedded metaphors and meaning. We wanted it to be both a visual and philosophical exploration and creation.\nThis project blends art, ecology, and technology to create an environment that evolves based on the contributions of each teammate. We have established pathways for the viewers or spectators to not only eye the art piece but interact with it. Our philosophy dictates that if art can’t make you stop, look and interact, if it can’t make you think, there is no point in calling it art. We didn’t want to infer the metaphor or the alt text we use in this, instead, we left it to the viewer with any discretion to figure out how the garden is laid out and the purpose of each element. Parallel to the beginning of every epic, we start off with the sky. The sky is the poetry cloud, a cluster of disconinuities laid out in a channel, they indicate the presence of divinity and pivot change. Then we proceed to the flowers, that change colour and shape and position, they embody all material objects. After which we have the trees, which grow and perish, they are used to metaphorise change. We have butterflies in the composition that embody the untimely notion of life and death and life after death. Finally we have a pond, a water body to symbolise rejuvenation.\nUsing p5.js, WEBL and learning how to put everything together felt difficult and overwhelming to a lot of us. But we persisted and figured out how to navigate through the tough times. For the purpose of creating our digital ecosystem, we considered and looked to Mother Nature for inspiration. We developed and formulated an ecosystem. Each element is a contribution of each individual and their creative expression in the most expressive way. It also reflects the diversity and convergence of our minds and ideas and how they all formulate and meet at a common ground. The purpose of this art piece is to evoke the sense of being in a garden and trying to visualise the garden but in a more visceral manner.\n\n\nGarden Elements & Math Concepts\n1) Flowers\nMath Concept: Parametric Equations\n\nThe flower shape is defined using parametric equations in polar coordinates.\nIn the code, this equation generates radial symmetry, giving the flower a structured petal arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Terrain\nMath Concept: Julia Fractals\n\nThe Julia set determines which areas are water or land.\nFormula: z=z^2+c\nThe rule takes a number, changes it using a formula and checks if it stays small or grows big.\nIn the code, it creates a procedural landscape where blue areas represent water, and green areas represent land.\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Trees\nMath Concept: Geometric Progression\n\nGeometric progression is a sequence where each term is multiplied by a fixed ratio.\nLn​=L0​×rn, where the branch length shrinks by 70% each step.\nEach branch recursively creates three smaller branches, reducing in size until the length is 10 or less.\n\n\n\n4) Butterflies\nMath Concept: Circular Motion\n\nCircular motion describes movement along a curved path where an object’s position changes based on sine and cosine functions.\nFormula: x=rcos(θ),y=rsin(θ)\nEach butterfly moves in a circular path by updating its xxx and yyy coordinates using cosine and sine functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n6) Clouds\nMath Concept: Euclidean Distance\n\nEuclidean distance measures how far two points are from each other in a straight line.\nFormula:\nd=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2d = d=(x2​−x1​)2+(y2​−y1​)2​\nIn the code, it calculates the distance between the mouse and each cloud to adjust their size and transparency.\nCloser clouds appear bigger and brighter, while farther clouds appear smaller and more transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess & Practise\nWe began by exploring natural patterns and generative algorithms, experimenting with different plant growth models, fractals and interactive elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Sketch\nAll of this came down for the production of this final sketch:\n:::  :::"

You believe in little things (or small-minded concepts) even though sages like Sanaka and others have spoken of the truth… why do you still cling to the transient, O mind? Truly follow the devotee, and realise that the real source of strength is that divine energy. ~Dr. Balamuralikrishna Music transcends human psyche. Not everyone can sing, but everyone can feel emotions. The mark of a exceptional singer is to evocative the ubiquitous ‘Bhaav’ or emotion inside the heart. Bhartanatyam as a dance form is celebrated and revered throughout the world. It’s foundation is on discipline and structure wrapped with devotion as a act of surrendering tot he supreme deity. Art can never die, it lives on the heart of the patreons. In this project we delve into Neural Networks, CNNs and error propagation. Keeping the technicals asides we are transforming the notion of classical and technological by bridging the gap with cybernetics and creative coding. The project creates an elegant outcome at the intersection of Bhartanatyam and contemporary machine learning technologies. The creative outcome of our inquiry is an interactive mudra detector that detects mudras in real time and plays a musical note linked to the same. Bharatanatyam is full of symbolism, with every mudra holding multiple layers of narrative, spiritual, and emotional meaning. This project aims to document and reinterpret these gestures in the framework of artificial intelligence, not to supplant the meaning but to create new pathways of interactive storytelling. By providing technology with the ability to hear and reply to these ancient movements, the project presents a dynamic archive and performing space that is both informative and creative. By uniting code and culture, and gesture and generative response, this project transcends being a tool, it becomes a extant interface between the past and present. It is an offering from algorithms’ precision to Bharatanatyam’s flowing grace, from silicon’s silence to the timbre of sound.\nWhat is left is a reminder that technology, applied with discretion, can be not a disruptor of tradition but its humble interpreter. This mudra detector is a little more than technological design, but an homage, a rhythmically encoded paean to the expressive intelligence of the human body, the heart of music, and the timeless beauty of classical art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main objective of this project is to develop a gesture recognition system that is able to:\n-Recognize major Bharatanatyam mudras via a webcam with the help of AI.\n-React to every mudra with corresponding visual and audio components that mirror or enhance its meaning or emotional content.\n-Develop a performative digital installation where movement from tradition meets computational interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n-Data Collection: A labeled dataset of Bharatanatyam mudra samples is generated with the webcam and the handpose model of ml5.js. A mudra is captured through each of the 21 keypoints of the hand.\n-Model Training: A neural network is trained custom with ml5.neuralNetwork to classify the gesture according to these keypoints.\n-Real-Time Interaction: The trained model is incorporated into a p5.js sketch that does real-time classification off webcam input.\nEmbodied Feedback System: -A recognized mudra invokes: -A distinctive sound (conventional instruments such as veena, flute, mridangam) -A generative image (e.g., mandala designs, color waves, Sanskrit words) -Optionally, physical lights with Arduino and RGB LEDs\n\nTools and Techniques p5.js, ml5.js, handpose model Custom sound samples and visual animations GitHub Pages or Glitch for online hosting\n\nExpected Outcomes: -A working web-based demo that recognizes and reacts to 4–6 distinct Bharatanatyam mudras. -A performative presentation showcasing the system in use — where mudras trigger audio-visual feedback. -An online archive/interface that introduces users to mudras, their meanings, and their recognition through AI."
